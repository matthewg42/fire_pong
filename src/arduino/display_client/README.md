Using Matt Little's display, which runs on a Teensy.

However, couldn't get a working upload mechanism to the Teensy (using Atmel FLip) - bitrot has set into that software and it no longer seems usable on either Linux or Windows.  :(

So... we're installing a second microcontroller into the display (Arduino Pro Mini FTW!).  Therefore no weird build procedure (yay!)
