Following big test, 2016-07-21 at Ian's place:

0.  Reverse RELAY_ON and RELAY_OFF, and centralize somewhere
1.  VictoryMode:
    a.  fix direction of small puff sequence
    b.  make bigg puffer puff shorter (s/100/30 works well)
2.  MusicMode fixes: 
    a.  When re-entering mode, cannot open device (still open from pervious use)
    b.  Too much fire - calm it down & re-tweak algorithm to focus more on bass
        -   perhaps have sensitivity adjustments per channel?
    c.  Add manual button processing
3.  Pi shutdon daemon - monitor end two buttons for 5 second press
4.  Verify solenoid close signal gets sent when solenoid testing done
5.  Small Puffer Firmware:
    a.  Watchdog resets
    b.  auto-close solenoid / sparker after being on for more than 2 seconds
